Kafka - is a publish/subscribe messaging model distributed log service

Usage Scenario: when you have a server which mutlicasts the user activity logs to several other servers such as NoSQL DB and Hadoop ,there is a chance to loose some messages and to have high latecny in delivring messages

kafka solves this problems --> your logs generator server acts as a producers and sends messages to kafka broker cluster and your NoSQL and Hadoop acts as consumers and subscribe to Kafka cluster and pulls these messages

logs distribution in kafka is acording to the topic , partions and repliation factor

when you want to send facbook user logs to NoSQL server and Hadoop then you should create a topic with name social and deep into that you can divide the topic into partitons such as americas, europe, asia

Zookeeper is used to elect the leader broker in the kafka cluster,it monitors the kafka cluster health and when a leader broker is down it will elect another broker node as the leader.

Earleir,zookeeper has dependencies with consumers and brokers but now they only with brokers
